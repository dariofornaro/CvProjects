# Collection of projects

This repository is a collection of some of my most relevant projects.




## Installation and description

- **Exercises_C++** is a collection of C++ exercises.  
  - *To run it* you just need to hit run in one of the available C++ editors. (e.g. VScode)
- **GCL_calculator** is a tool to write GLC(Guarded Language Command). In this tool, we implemented a parser, a compiler and an interpreter. We were a group of 3 in the development of this project and we chose to use agile techniques as pair programming and a constant values deliver. 
  - The language is F# and *to run it* you need to run the file *Calculator.fsx* and follow the menu. To have an idea about how
    GLC works you can have a look at this website (http://www.formalmethods.dk/fm4fun/)
- **WebApp** is a web app written in Java adopting the spring framework. The website is about a remote container management system where you can perform operations like
  booking a container, delivering it, check its status. We also created a login system where you can log in as a logistic company owner or a customer. 
    This project lasted almost 2 months, we were a group of 5; 2 people were dealing with the agile part and the code testing and 3 people with front-end and back-end. I was dealing with the back-end and we were coding following a BDD approach. 
    - *To run* the server you need to have maven installed in your IDE
- **RicochetRobots** is a board game where a determined number of players has to reach some targets in the shortest moves possible. 
    The goal was to code the game in python and play versus the computer by making it move with the shortest number of moves. 
    To do it, we used different searching algorithms and we did a benchmark of them (BFS, DFS and A*). 
    In this project, we were 4 people and I contributed to developing the graphic representation of the game and in writing the A* algorithm. 
    - *To run it* you just need to run the main.py and follow the interactive menu.
